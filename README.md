# AI-Shakespeare-NLP-Driven-Text-Generation

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the AI Shakespeare project, where I explore natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques to generate text in the style of William Shakespeare. This project was developed as part of my ongoing studies in data science and artificial intelligence.

## 1. Introduction
### Purpose
The objective of this project is to reconstruct Shakespearean dialogue using deep learning models, specifically designed to emulate the unique style and structure of Shakespeare's works. This involves processing raw text data, building a neural network model, and generating new text that closely resembles the original Shakespearean writing.

### Tech Stack
- **Languages and Libraries:** Python, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas
- **Data Source:** The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset of Shakespeare's works, available in the `shakespeare.txt` file.

## 2. Project Scope
This project covers data preprocessing, model building, training, and text generation. The main goal is to develop a robust deep learning model capable of generating coherent and stylistically accurate Shakespearean text.

## 3. Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and tokenizing the text data, creating sequences for model input.
- **Model Building:** Using an LSTM-based neural network architecture with Embedding, Dropout, Dense, GRU, and LSTM layers.
- **Model Training:** Training the model on the processed text data, tuning hyperparameters to optimize performance.
- **Text Generation:** Generating new Shakespearean text using the trained model, showcasing the model's ability to emulate Shakespeare's writing style.

## 4. Dataset
The dataset consists of the complete works of William Shakespeare, including his plays and sonnets. This text data is processed to create sequences used for training the deep learning model.

## 5. Results
The model successfully generates text that closely mimics the style and structure of Shakespearean dialogue. The generated text demonstrates the model's ability to learn and reproduce complex linguistic patterns.

## 6. Future Enhancements
- **Model Improvement:** Experimenting with other neural network architectures and hyperparameter tuning.
- **Text Diversity:** Enhancing the diversity and coherence of generated text by incorporating more varied datasets.
- **Deployment:** Developing a web application to allow real-time text generation and interaction.

## 7. Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of NLP and deep learning techniques to generate text in the style of a renowned author. The AI Shakespeare project showcases the potential of deep learning models to replicate complex writing styles and provides a foundation for further exploration in text generation and literary emulation.

## 8. Files in Repository
- **AI Shakespeare NLP Driven Text Generation Code.ipynb:** Jupyter notebook with the complete analysis, model building, and text generation process.
- **shakespeare.txt:** Dataset containing the complete works of William Shakespeare.
